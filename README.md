The RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) cryptosystem is a widely adopted public-key encryption method that employs a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The process of RSA encryption and decryption entails intricate mathematical operations, often with large prime numbers. This application demonstrates step-by-step encryption with the RSA Algorithm to ensure the authenticity of the message. The sender encrypts the message with its private key and the receiver decrypts with the sender's public key.
